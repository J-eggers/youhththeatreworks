                    </h1>
                    <p class="lead">About Us Youth Theatre Works (YTW) is a non-profit theatre company that has
                        supported inclusion and cooperation of all abilities within the arts for more than fifteen
                        years. Founded by Barbara Durost and Kathy Kilsby, YTW has laid the foundation for creating
                        performance theatre that strives to teach kids not just how to act and sing, but also how to
                        work together, sing together, and help each other – both onstage and offstage.

                    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                    <p class="lead">At Youth Theatre Works we foster each child's individual talents and abilities
                        while teaching mutual respect and appreciation for one another's differences and unique
                        contributions to each theatrical production we present. We have an open-door policy and accept
                        participants at every level of experience and ability. Our non-profit, non-tuition-based
                        programs are process oriented and designed to include all children regardless of their
                        financial situation. Students mentor each other and are vital creators of each production.
                        Participants see their work and that of their peers as indispensable elements of a whole. In
                        addition to invaluable experience in theater craft, children walk away with increased
                        confidence, sense of self and appreciation of others.

                        <p>Haylee Coburn is a proud alumna of Youth Theatre Works! She fell in love with the program
                            after her first production, The Boyfriend (2004). Inspired by YTW, Haylee went on to study
                            vocal music at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts where she earned a
                            scholarship from the Flora Thornton Foundation. Later, she received a Bachelor Fine Arts in
